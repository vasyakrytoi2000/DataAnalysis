# Here is a collection of some of the laboratory work I did during my studiesðŸŽ“
[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=vscode,py,postgres )](https://skillicons.dev)
## A little about disciplines:
### Algorithms and data structuresðŸ”—: 
As the name suggests, we studied recursion, various sorting algorithms, data structures such as arrays, linked lists, queues, and trees. In general, it can be described like this:
- ***lab1*** : A script that, depending on the number of disks on the Tower of Hanoi, returns the minimum number of moves required to solve the problem. Also, a script that simply returns the sum of even and odd numbers in an array.
- ***lab2*** : Simply implement two sorting algorithms: insertion sort and quick sort. Also implemented are measurements of the time spent on sorting.
- ***lab3*** : Something like a text editor with the simplest functions. 2 options: linked list and dynamic array (python list)
- ***lab4*** : Here a bidirectional queue is implemented, again using a linked list and a dynamic array (python list)
- ***lab5*** : In this work I implemented a binary search tree (BST). There is nothing particularly interesting

### Data AnalysisðŸ“Š:
Mainly working with pandas dataframes and the seaborn library. Regular laboratory tasks with tasks that every specialist in this field should be able to solve. In general:
- working with datasets
- working with dataframes
- building graphs

### DataBasesðŸ—‚:
We studied SQL query language, I personally worked with PostgreSQL using pgAdmin 4.
Nothing special, all laboratory work was carried out according to the methodological instructions.
There is also a coursework on the topic "Database for a football match"
