# Here are collected the laboratory works that I performed during my studiesðŸŽ“

## Brief information about each of the laboratory works :
[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=py,vscode)](https://skillicons.dev)

### Laba 2 
![Jupyter](https://img.shields.io/badge/Jupyter-Notebook-orange?logo=jupyter&logoColor=white) ![Pandas](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pandas-DataFrame-blue?logo=pandas&logoColor=white)

In this work, it was necessary to perform several tasks, in general, the first cell automatically creates a directory in the current location and downloads datasets from the [site](https://www.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/smcd/emb/vci/VH/vh_browseByCountry_province.php), each dataset contains different indices for a certain region of Ukraine in a different period of time. The following cells simply perform different tasks, for example, creating a dataframe, determining the VHI for a certain region for a specified year, finding the extreme, average and median of the VHI for a certain region and year, and so on

### Laba 3
![Pandas](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pandas-DataFrame-blue?logo=pandas&logoColor=white) ![Streamlit](https://img.shields.io/badge/Streamlit-App-FF4B4B?logo=streamlit&logoColor=white) ![Seaborn](https://img.shields.io/badge/Seaborn-Statistical_Visualization-4C72B0?logo=seaborn&logoColor=white)

In this work, Streamlit was used to display the filtered data and its graphs, built using Seaborn. The data is used from the same [site](https://www.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/smcd/emb/vci/VH/vh_browseByCountry_province.php), and is automatically downloaded or updated

### Laba 4
![Jupyter](https://img.shields.io/badge/Jupyter-Notebook-orange?logo=jupyter&logoColor=white) ![Pandas](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pandas-DataFrame-blue?logo=pandas&logoColor=white) ![NumPy](https://img.shields.io/badge/NumPy-Numerical_Computing-013243?logo=numpy&logoColor=white)

Almost the same as in ***lab 2***, but the tasks were performed using both pandas dataframes and numpy arrays. The data is again loaded automatically, from the following [site](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/235/individual%2Bhousehold%2Belectric%2Bpower%2Bconsumption))

### Laba 5
![Matplotlib](https://img.shields.io/badge/Matplotlib-Plotting-2CA5E0?logo=matplotlib&logoColor=white) ![Bokeh](https://img.shields.io/badge/Bokeh-InteractivePlots-purple?logo=bokeh&logoColor=white)

Almost the same as in ***lab 2***, but the tasks were performed using both pandas dataframes and numpy arrays. The data is again loaded automatically, from the following [site](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/235/individual%2Bhousehold%2Belectric%2Bpower%2Bconsumption))
