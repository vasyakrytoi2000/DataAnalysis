In this work, it was necessary to perform several tasks, in general, the first cell automatically creates a directory in the current location and downloads datasets from the [site](https://www.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/smcd/emb/vci/VH/vh_browseByCountry_province.php), each dataset contains different indices for a certain region of Ukraine in a different period of time. The following cells simply perform different tasks, for example, creating a dataframe, determining the VHI for a certain region for a specified year, finding the extreme, average and median of the VHI for a certain region and year, and so on
